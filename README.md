I'm still learning the rust programming language and thought that the advent of code would be good practice.
Unfortunately I was unable to finish to due personal circumstances, but I'm mostly happy with what I have.
Although it's super messy. Absolute spaghetti code. I did not clean up on like all of them.
Might as well upload this as a comparison for next time I do the challenge!
